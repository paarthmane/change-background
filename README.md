# change-background
Main focus creating this project to impliment javascript dom manipulation basics 
all buttons were by using javascript, appended them inside of container so that i can put display flex on it 
right now the button text color stays same as the color of background but after some time it shoud turn to it's original color and i don't know how to do it i tried to ude settimeout method but it's not working for me
